# Notes

Hi everyone, this is [me](link to social media?). I take notes, which can be found below:
 - [Algebraic Geometry](latex/AG.pdf)
 - [Differential Geometry](latex/DG.pdf)
 - [Some other pure course](example.com)

 If you happen to use these notes and find any errors then the most helpful thing you could do would be to create a pull request with the updated tex files. Even just correcting a typo or two would be helpful.
